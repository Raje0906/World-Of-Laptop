# Rate Limiting Fix for Health Endpoint

## Problem
The frontend was getting 429 "Too Many Requests" errors when calling the `/api/health` endpoint due to rate limiting.

## Root Cause
1. **Backend Rate Limiting**: The health endpoint was being rate limited (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP)
2. **Frequent Health Checks**: Multiple frontend components were making frequent health checks:
   - `SafeApiClient`: Every 30 seconds
   - `useQuietHealth`: Every 60 seconds
   - Each API request also triggered health checks

## Solution

### 1. Backend Changes (server.js)
- ✅ Excluded `/api/health` from rate limiting
- ✅ Added better error handling for rate limit errors
- ✅ Added comment indicating health endpoint is not rate limited

### 2. Frontend Changes
- ✅ Reduced `SafeApiClient` health check frequency from 30s to 60s
- ✅ Reduced `useQuietHealth` check frequency from 60s to 120s (2 minutes)
- ✅ Added specific handling for 429 errors (don't mark backend as unavailable)
- ✅ Improved error handling in health checks

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/server.js`: Excluded health endpoint from rate limiting

### Frontend
- `src/services/safeApi.ts`: Reduced check frequency and added 429 error handling
- `src/hooks/useQuietHealth.ts`: Reduced check frequency

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend Changes
```bash
# Commit and push backend changes
git add backend/server.js
git commit -m "Fix: Exclude health endpoint from rate limiting"
git push origin main

# Render will automatically redeploy
```

### 2. Deploy Frontend Changes
```bash
# Commit and push frontend changes
git add src/services/safeApi.ts src/hooks/useQuietHealth.ts
git commit -m "Fix: Reduce health check frequency and handle rate limits"
git push origin main

# Vercel will automatically redeploy
```

### 3. Test the Fix
```bash
# Run the test script
node test-health-endpoint.js
```

## Expected Results

After deployment:
- ✅ Health endpoint should not return 429 errors
- ✅ Frontend should show "Online" status consistently
- ✅ Reduced server load from fewer health checks
- ✅ Better user experience with fewer connection errors

## Monitoring

Monitor these metrics after deployment:
- 429 error rate in server logs
- Health endpoint response times
- Frontend connection status indicators
- Overall API performance

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert the rate limiting exclusion in `backend/server.js`
2. Revert the frequency changes in frontend files
3. Deploy the rollback changes

## Notes

- The health endpoint is now completely excluded from rate limiting
- Health checks are now less frequent to reduce server load
- 429 errors are handled gracefully without marking backend as unavailable
- This should resolve the connection status issues in the UI
