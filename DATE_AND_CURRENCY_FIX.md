# Date Validation and Currency Fix

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Date Validation Error (400 Bad Request)
**Issue**: The daily sales API was returning a 400 error for the date `2025-08-12` due to strict date validation.

**Root Cause**: The backend validation was only allowing dates within 1 year past to 1 year future, but `2025-08-12` was beyond this range.

**Solution**: Extended the date validation range to allow dates up to 2 years in the future.

### 2. Currency Display (USD → INR)
**Issue**: The frontend was displaying currency in USD ($) instead of Indian Rupees (₹).

**Root Cause**: Currency formatting functions were using `en-US` locale and `USD` currency.

**Solution**: Updated all currency formatting to use `en-IN` locale and `INR` currency.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Extended Date Validation (`backend/routes/sales.js`)
```javascript
// Before: 1 year past to 1 year future
const oneYearFromNow = new Date(now.getFullYear() + 1, now.getMonth(), now.getDate());

// After: 1 year past to 2 years future  
const twoYearsFromNow = new Date(now.getFullYear() + 2, now.getMonth(), now.getDate());
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. DailySales Component (`src/pages/sales/DailySales.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated currency formatting from USD to INR
- ✅ Extended date validation to match backend (2 years future)
- ✅ Updated error messages to reflect new date range

#### 2. RepairDetails Component (`src/pages/repairs/RepairDetails.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated currency formatting from USD to INR

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/routes/sales.js`: Extended date validation range

### Frontend  
- `src/pages/sales/DailySales.tsx`: Currency and date validation fixes
- `src/pages/repairs/RepairDetails.tsx`: Currency formatting fix

## Testing

### Test Scripts Created
- `test-daily-sales.js`: Tests daily sales API with various dates including `2025-08-12`

### Test Cases
- ✅ `2025-08-12` (previously failing date)
- ✅ `2024-12-25` (current year)
- ✅ `2025-01-01` (near future)
- ✅ `2026-06-15` (far future)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend Changes
```bash
git add backend/routes/sales.js
git commit -m "Fix: Extend date validation range for daily sales API"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy Frontend Changes
```bash
git add src/pages/sales/DailySales.tsx src/pages/repairs/RepairDetails.tsx
git commit -m "Fix: Update currency to INR and extend date validation"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Test the Fixes
```bash
# Test daily sales API
node test-daily-sales.js

# Test health endpoint (from previous fix)
node test-health-endpoint.js
```

## Expected Results

After deployment:

### Date Validation
- ✅ `2025-08-12` should work without 400 errors
- ✅ Future dates up to 2 years ahead should be accepted
- ✅ Past dates within 1 year should still work
- ✅ Dates beyond the range should show appropriate error messages

### Currency Display
- ✅ All prices should display in Indian Rupees (₹)
- ✅ Currency formatting should use Indian locale (en-IN)
- ✅ Numbers should be formatted according to Indian standards

## Verification

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to Daily Sales page
2. Select date `2025-08-12`
3. Verify no 400 errors occur
4. Verify currency displays as ₹ instead of $
5. Test with other future dates

### API Testing
```bash
# Test the specific date that was failing
curl "https://world-of-laptop.onrender.com/api/sales/daily?date=2025-08-12"
```

## Notes

- The backend already had INR currency formatting in config files
- Only frontend components needed currency updates
- Date validation is now consistent between frontend and backend
- All changes are backward compatible
- Error messages have been updated to reflect new date ranges
