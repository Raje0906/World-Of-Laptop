# Dashboard UI Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed System Status Box
**Issue**: The dashboard displayed a system status box that was taking up space and showing technical information.

**Solution**: Completely removed the QuietSystemStatus component from the SimpleDashboard.

### 2. Added Welcome Message
**Enhancement**: Added a prominent welcome message in the center of the available space.

**Implementation**: 
- Added "Welcome to World of Laptops" heading
- Added descriptive subtitle about the CRM system
- Centered the message with proper spacing and styling
